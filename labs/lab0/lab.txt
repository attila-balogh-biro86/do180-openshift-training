The OpenShift Developer Sandbox is a short-lived cluster in the cloud.
- You request one for you and it will be deleted after a few days (30 days).
- You can request a new one as many times as you wish, you just won't be able to keep apps and data long-term,
and you won't have full administrator privileges.

Steps:

1. Create a Red Hat Developer account if you don't have one already.
You can create one at https://developers.redhat.com/register

2. Visit https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox and login with your Red Hat Developer account.

3. Click on the "Start your sandbox for free" button.

4. Wait for approval, and after you see the "You're ready to get started" click again on the "Start your sandbox for free" button.

5. After a few seconds you will be redirected to your OpenShift Web console, click on the Log in with "DevSandbox" button.

5b. After successful login at the first time you have to fill a short form.
