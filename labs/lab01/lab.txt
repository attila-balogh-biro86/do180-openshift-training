DEMO - Using the RHEL8 Universal Boot Image


1. Search for Containers (specifically UBI)
podman search registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8

2. Choose and run a container accessing the bash shell
sudo podman run -it registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi /bin/bash
When running a container, it is possible to pass -it as a command line option and then specify an interactive shell such as /bin/bash

3. Verify that you are running the container and accessing the container shell.
cat /etc/redhat-release

4. Change or Modify the Container - Install a package
yum install httpd

5. Attempt to Enable Daemon for HTTPD with SystemD
systemctl enable httpd --now

6. Run the HTTP package
httpd&

7. Test the Webserver
curl http://localhost

8. Exit from this container and mark the containerID (root@something)

9. Attempt to run the container again
sudo podman run -it registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi /bin/bash and after that exit

9. List containers
sudo podman ps -a // Observe the different containerIds


Clean Up
// sudo podman rm containerId can be used to remove containers which are not in use anymore
